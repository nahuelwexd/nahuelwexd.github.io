### Hi there! This is my personal website ðŸ˜‰

This is a website that I built with [**TypeScript**](https://www.typescriptlang.org), [**Next.js**](https://nextjs.org),
and [**Tailwind CSS**](https://tailwindcss.com).

#### How I run this?

Well, first you need to have Node.js installed, version 10.13 or later, and then just run

```sh
npm i
# and
npm run dev
```

and that's it. Open your browser a you'll find my website on your http://localhost:3000 ðŸ˜Š
